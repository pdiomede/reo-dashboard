## [0.0.18] - 2025-11-25

### Changed
- **Improved Grace Period Calculation** - Made grace period status determination more robust
  - Added configurable buffer period (default: 24 hours) before `last_oracle_update_time` cutoff
  - Indexers who renewed within buffer period are now considered eligible instead of in grace period
  - Reduces false warnings caused by oracle update delays, processing delays, or network latency
  - Buffer configurable via `GRACE_BUFFER_PERIOD_HOURS` in `.env` file (default: 24)
  - More forgiving eligibility logic prevents unnecessary panic for compliant indexers
  - Formula: Eligible if `eligibility_renewal_time >= (last_oracle_update_time - buffer)`

### Technical
- Added `GRACE_BUFFER_PERIOD_HOURS` environment variable support in `.env`
- Updated `checkEligibility()` function to accept `grace_buffer_hours` parameter
- Enhanced status determination logic to use buffer cutoff instead of exact timestamp comparison
- Added console output showing buffer cutoff time for transparency
